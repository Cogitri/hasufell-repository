SUMMARY="Simple, elegant, Pythonic functional programming"
DESCRIPTION="
Coconut is a functional programming language that compiles to Python. Since all
valid Python is valid Coconut, using Coconut will only extend and enhance what
you're already capable of in Python.

Why use Coconut? Coconut is built to be fundamentally useful. Coconut enhances
the repertoire of Python programmers to include the tools of modern functional
programming, in such a way that those tools are easy to use and immensely
powerful; that is, Coconut does to functional programming what Python did to
imperative programming. And Coconut code runs the same on any Python version,
making the Python 2/3 split a thing of the past.

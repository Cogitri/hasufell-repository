SUMMARY="A fork of Python 2 and 3 ast modules with type comment support"
DESCRIPTION="
typed_ast is a Python 3 package that provides a Python 2.7 and Python 3 parser similar to the standard ast library. Unlike ast, the parsers in typed_ast include PEP 484 type comments and are independent of the version of Python under which they are run. The typed_ast parsers produce the standard Python AST (plus type comments), and are both fast and correct, as they are based on the CPython 2.7 and 3.6 parser
